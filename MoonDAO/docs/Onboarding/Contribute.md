***Everything you see around you is created by MoonDAO contributors.***

MoonDAO is an open-source community, anyone can contribute to our mission of accelerating the creation of a lunar base.

MoonDAO does not work like most traditional corporate organizations, in fact, we never intend to become a "company" in the traditional sense. We are a DAO. We are open for anyone in the world to work with us. All contributors are classified as independent contractors and are responsible for taxes in their respective jurisdiction that result from any rewards or compensation from their contributions.

## There are many levels of involvement with MoonDAO.

## Level 0: Join the MoonDAO Contributor Community
The most successful contributors at MoonDAO are self-starters, and the most direct path to successful contribution is through networking by joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/moondao), introducing yourself, and sharing your skills and interests. We encourage members to attend our weekly meetings to gain context on the DAO's goals, current needs, and key players before taking action to contribute. 

Any contributions that help the DAO and our mission can receive retroactive rewards. Community contributors can share their proof of work and the impact of their efforts in the [Submit Contribution](https://moondao.com/contribute) page. If vouched for by two of our core contributors, the contributions are posted for consideration in our quarterly rewards cycle. [Learn more](Community%20Rewards.md). If the work helps advance MoonDAO, or our mission, it is eligible!

This contribution level is not a prerequisite for joining a project, but it can be an excellent first step.

## Level 1: Join a MoonDAO Project

MoonDAO Projects are non-perpetual, goal-based teams that are approved to execute autonomously. MoonDAO teams have no over-head from [MoonDAO governance](Governance%20Model.md). 

You may work with a team or as an individual working on a key objective for the DAO. The DAO will vote to allocate resources and a budget for your project and you’d be eligible for retroactive rewards.

MoonDAO projects are autonomous units and may be incorporated into separate legal entities to complete their mission. As the projects grow they may incubate and eventually become their own sub-DAOs. When you first join a MoonDAO project, you'll join as a Project Contributor.

## Level 2: Lead a MoonDAO Project

Create a new project or get funding for something you’re already doing by proposing a [MoonDAO project](https://moondao.com/submit). This comes with the added responsibility of being a Senate member and having a seat on the governing body that first reviews new MoonDAO projects before going up for a vote by the Member House.

Leading a MoonDAO project is a larger commitment, you would steward the project from proposal to completion, and be responsible for putting together a core team, reporting back on progress to the DAO on a weekly basis, and completing the objectives of the project on time.

## Level 3: Become an Elected Leader

The Astronaut role is given to elected leaders that are trusted with stewarding the DAO and helping guide it as it becomes increasingly decentralized. This is the highest level of contribution to the DAO. The DAO holds annual votes to select an astronaut on staggered three-year terms, as detailed in our [Constitution](Constitution.md).

## Rewards

All contributors receive our governance token as staked $vMOONEY and are paid with ETH that is distributed each quarter through our retroactive rewards process. Members vote on which projects have had the most impact that quarter and how much of the quarterly rewards amount should go toeach project using our [Allocate Rewards](https://moondao.com/rewards) page.

If you have questions and want to learn more, check out our [frequently asked questions](https://docs.moondao.com/About/FAQ). While it's not necessary to become a Citizen or Voting Member prior to contributing, it is highly recommended.
