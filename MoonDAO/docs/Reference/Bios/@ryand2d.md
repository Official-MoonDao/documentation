Ryan joined MoonDAO in August 2022, right after the launch of Coby Cotton, motivated by the vision of decentralizing access to space. Ryan has served on MoonDAO's senate for over a year and a half, and contributed to numerous MoonDAO projects and initiatives, including our [weekly newsletter](https://app.moondao.com/news), a ZeroG adventure alongside three NASA astronauts, and has been coordinating social media and communications as part of the Executive Branch.
