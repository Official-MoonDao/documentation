Hey I’m Jade. I’ve been in crypto since 2015, when I started buying bitcoin and never really stopped. In 2017, I built an NFT project and marketplace—originally to sell fidget spinners on the blockchain—which ended up being my gateway into smart contract development. I’ve been building ever since.

Right now I work on smart contracts at MoonDAO, helping coordinate decentralized efforts to expand human access to space. I also contributed to the ConstitutionDAO fundraiser, which was one of the wildest, most inspiring experiments in collective action I’ve been part of.

I’m interested in how crypto can enable new ways of organizing people and resources without relying on centralized platforms.
