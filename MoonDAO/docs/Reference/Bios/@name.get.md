Hi there! I am a fullstack developer specializing in cutting-edge web2 and web3 technologies. My expertise lies in leveraging powerful frameworks and libraries such as NextJS, ReactJS, CSS, SASS, TailwindCSS, ThreeJS, MongoDB, Firebase, and Thirdweb.

Since joining MoonDAO in late October 2022, I have been an active contributor, collaborating with like-minded individuals to push the boundaries of what's possible in the web3 space. Together, we are shaping the future of decentralized technologies and fostering a vibrant community of innovators.
