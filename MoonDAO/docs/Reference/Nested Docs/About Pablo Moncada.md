## Full Biography
Pablo Moncada-Larrotiz is a notable figure in the field of decentralized technology, especially known for co-founding MoonDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) aimed at democratizing space exploration. Before venturing into the realm of DAOs, he worked as a software engineer at Google, where his roles spanned projects at Waymo, YouTube, and other initiatives such as working on exoskeletons for enhancing lower body mobility. He was also a core developer for ConstitutionDAO, a DAO that raised $47 million to purchase an original copy of the U.S. Constitution from Sotheby's. Pablo's journey also includes time at a biotech start-up focusing on engineering human tissues. His educational background includes studies in Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, and Business at the University of Michigan.

MoonDAO, under his leadership, aims to make space accessible to all, transcending the traditional barriers that have kept space exploration exclusive to the privileged few. This project has involved raising funds through innovative means like crypto-token sales and NFTs to finance tickets to space and support space research and exploration initiatives. His vision extends to potentially establishing a Moon settlement under a new model of governance.
