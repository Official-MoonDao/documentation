***Everything you see around you is created by MoonDAO contributors.***

MoonDAO is an open-source community, anyone can contribute to our mission of accelerating the creation of a lunar base.

# There are three main methods of contribution:

- Join an existing [Project](https://docs.moondao.com/Projects/Project-System). 
- Add a contribution directly in the [submit contribution](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1179874302447853659channel) and be vouched for by existing members.
- Create a new project or get funding for something youâ€™re already doing by posting in our [ideation forum](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1027658256706961509).

Contributors receive our governance token as staked $vMOONEY and are paid with ETH that is distributed among members each quarter. Members select which projects have had the most impact each quarter and vote to distribute tokens to each project using [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/).

While it's not necessary to stake and vote within MoonDAO before contributing, it is highly recommended to become a member before joining as a contributor.
