# MoonDAO's Governance Guide

**Step 0: Unlock Governance** 
If you’re not yet a member, you can become one [here](https://moondao.com/join). This will allow you to vote on proposals in our Snapshot space (new proposals are [published once a week](https://vote.moondao.com) on Thursdays)

**Step 1: Ideation** 
Even if you’re not a member, you can pitch an idea or weigh in on ideas in ⁠https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1027658256706961509 - there is no formal structure to post, and anyone can share a loose idea. No pressure. 

**Step 2: Submit a Proposal** 
When you’re ready you may submit your proposal, you can do so [here](https://moondao.com/propose). A @Delegate will need to approve the proposal (a @Delegate is someone with 250,000 vMOONEY that can submit on your behalf - or if you have that amount, you may submit directly). Most successful submissions have been discussed in ideation, but you may also submit directly ⁠without a thread in ideation. 

**Step 3: Townhall Discussion** 
**Every Thursday at 7PM UTC** we discuss proposals in ⁠https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/917498630510878821. Everyone is welcome to listen and participate. We record these meetings as well and you can view them on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@officialmoondao). 

- **Wednesday 7PM UTC:** Senate Proposal Review Submission Deadline. 
The proposal may be edited until the Townhall, but the submission should at least be completed by this time.
- **Thursday 7PM UTC:** Townhall Discussion. 
Please be prepared to present your proposal there after you submit and answer questions.
- **Friday 12:00 AM UTC:** Snapshot Vote Opens.
- **Wednesday 12:00 AM UTC:** Snapshot Vote closes.
- If passed we proceed to on-chain execution and queue the transaction for review by the treasury multi-sig signers.
