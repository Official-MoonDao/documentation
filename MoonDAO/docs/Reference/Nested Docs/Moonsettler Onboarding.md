# Welcome to MoonDAO: Moonsettler Onboarding 

Welcome aboard, Moonsettler! As a contributor to MoonDAO, you are now embarking on a journey of exploration, innovation, and collaboration! This guide will help you on your way, and set the right expectations for contributing on a MoonDAO Project
## Moonsettler Expectations

At MoonDAO we have the following expectations for Moonsettlers

🧘‍♀️ **Be Present:** Attend project meetings and offer feedback. We’re all remote so sometimes communication can fall through the cracks, being present helps the team coordinate more effectively.  

💁‍♂️ **Deliver:** As long as you are delivering on the expectations set by the project lead in a timely way and attending necessary meetings, you can make your own hours and work on your own time

🤓 **Learn:** We have a long history and culture at MoonDAO, and we hope you take the steps to learn more about how we operate! This guide will point you to the right resources to learn more

👩‍❤️‍👨 **Share:** Update people on progress quickly and offer feedback as soon as you see it. Contest ideas freely but always respect each other as individuals! Post in social channels and engage the community!
