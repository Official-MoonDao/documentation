### What is MoonDAO?
MoonDAO is a collective of people from [all over the world](https://moondao.com/map) that are accelerating the development of a self-sustaining, self-governing settlement on the Moon to act as a launch point into the cosmos.

### What is $MOONEY?
$MOONEY is the token we use to govern and coordinate our community. To govern MoonDAO you must lock $MOONEY for some period of time to get voting power. You can read more about how this works in our [governance documentation](Governance%20Model.md) and [constitution](Constitution.md). There will always be a fixed supply of $MOONEY, see [analytics](https://moondao.com/analytics). There is no expectation of profit with this token. You are not receiving fractionalized ownership of the DAO’s assets in exchange for the token. No element of the $MOONEY and/or Ticket To Space NFTs qualifies or is intended to be an offering of securities in any jurisdiction, nor does it constitute an offer or an invitation to purchase shares, securities or other financial products. Please check our website’s FAQs for more information and disclaimers. You can learn more about the tokenomics of $MOONEY [here](Governance%20Tokens.md).

### How do I acquire $MOONEY?
If you already have a wallet with ETH, you can acquire $MOONEY [here](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x20d4DB1946859E2Adb0e5ACC2eac58047aD41395&chain=mainnet)via Uniswap. If this sounds like a foreign language to you, we’ve made a simple method of purchasing $MOONEY with a credit card or debit card along with wallet creation via email or social login in our [website](https://www.moondao.com/get-mooney).

### How does voting at MoonDAO work?
We publish proposals on [our website](https://moondao.com/vote)and members with voting power can vote on the proposals, a proposal passes if the super majority (2/3rds) of the voting power agrees with executing the proposal. Your voting power is calculated quadratically based on how much $MOONEY you lock, and for how long. In other words, we take the square root of the number of tokens that you’ve locked, and the longer you lock the more voting power you get.

### Why do I need to lock to vote?
We want our community to be controlled by those with a long-term view and commitment to our mission. Locking measures commitment by restricting tokens for some amount of time. The amount and duration is determined when selecting during the locking process. Users can purchase any amount of [$MOONEY via Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x20d4DB1946859E2Adb0e5ACC2eac58047aD41395&chain=mainnet) and [lock](https://www.moondao.com/lock) some or all of that for any amount of time between one week and four years. 

### What do I get in exchange for locking $MOONEY?
Locking gives you governance inside of the community. [Our treasury](https://moondao.com/analytics) is co-governed by all $vMOONEY holders. All our financial decisions are approved by them. You can vote on proposals [here](http://moondao.com/vote).

### How do I contribute to MoonDAO?
MoonDAO is organized into teams called “Projects,” you can view the ongoing projects that have open roles or are looking for contributors by becoming a Citizen and visiting the [job board](https://moondao.com/jobs), which also includes space job postings from outside Teams.

### How do I submit a Proposal to MoonDAO?
Anyone can start the proposal process by joining the [Discord](https://discord.gg/moondao) and posting in our [ideation](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1027658256706961509) channel. From there, you will fill out a [Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8rV9RlvFk6nAJzWh-tvroyPvasjjrvgKpyX8ibGX3I/edit) and [submit it](https://moondao.com/submit) to our governance. The proposal will be reviewed by the MoonDAO Senate, and if it passes the review process it will be voted on by our members. See our [[Governance Model]] to learn more.

### How is my voting power calculated?
We take the square root of your locked balance. This is known as quadratic voting. This helps prevent large holders from dominating decisions, promoting a more balanced influence across all participants, regardless of their token holdings.
