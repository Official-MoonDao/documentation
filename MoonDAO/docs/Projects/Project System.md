# MoonDAO Projects v8.0  

MoonDAO Projects are the launch point for mission-aligned people to build on top of the foundation and network of MoonDAO.  

MoonDAO Projects are goal-oriented teams working on mission-aligned objectives. This document provides the framework to fund the team, support their progress, align their interests with the DAO, and provide retroactive incentives for projects that get us one step closer to a permanent settlement on the Moon.  

MoonDAO Projects consist of Project Contributors and a Project Lead. Each Project is represented in the MoonDAO Senate by their Project Lead.

## Proposal Process

**Step 1: Post in the “[ideation](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1027658256706961509)” channel on Discord.** You don’t need to have a fully formed idea for a project yet, and you can be pretty informal at this stage. There are two things to articulate in the ideation channel: 
1.) Problem to be solved.
2.) Proposed solution.

This is meant to help YOU get feedback from people on the idea, offer alternative solutions, and allow for informal coordination around ideas. Anyone can post about ideas regardless of their background in the DAO, even if they aren’t yet part of our community.

**Step 2: Proposal Submission.** A Project Proposal ([MoonDAO Project Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8rV9RlvFk6nAJzWh-tvroyPvasjjrvgKpyX8ibGX3I/edit#heading=h.wq6048m686gd)) must be filled out. The proposal must be submitted **24 hours before** the Senate meeting. If the proposal does not follow its relevant template, then it will not be considered valid and will not go forward for a Senate vote. Any pre-commitments in terms of compensation for team members must be expressed in ETH. See our Proposal Process for more information on how proposals are passed. You can submit your proposal [here](https://moondao.com/propose). All project proposals are due by the fourth townhall of the quarter (i.e. approximately one month into the quarter), all proposals will be batched together for a ranked-choice vote. The top 50% of projects will be approved.

## Start

The Project’s Lead becomes a member of the **Senate** as outlined in our DAO Constitution. Members of the Senate retain their position until the end of the quarter when their objective is completed. Senate members are required to attend weekly Senate meetings and required to vote and review incoming proposals. 

**Payment method setup:** If a project member is receiving a fixed payment upfront for their work, the project multisig may stream the payment over the course of the project until the project’s deadline. Payment streaming may be turned off by the team’s multisig if a member is no longer fulfilling their responsibilities. Alternatively, the project may send half the payment at the beginning of the project, and the other half at the end.

## Updates And Responsibilities

Throughout the lifetime of the Project the **Lead** must do the following:  

**1. Provide Mid-Point Progress Updates to the Senate.** One month into the quarter the team must provide a written report and present it at the townhall meeting. This is intended to be a helpful meeting to give context to the DAO on progress and also have the DAO find ways to support the project. However, if the project is not meeting the expectations of their project or no progress has been made, then the Executive Leads may shut the project down. If a project is shut down, all remaining funds must be returned to the DAO.

**2. Attend weekly Senate meetings.** Project Leads must attend the weekly townhalls and are required to vote on Senate decisions as outlined in the DAO Constitution. They are required to help review incoming project proposals and encouraged to share their thoughts on matters of DAO governance. Failure to attend meetings without notice or not vote in a timely manner will result in penalties to retroactive compensation. **For each missed Senate vote, defined as no vote within 24 hours of the proposal being active, the team will be deducted 5% of their retroactive rewards.** If a Senate member misses more than three votes, the project may be shut down. Special exceptions can be made for members on different time zones where attendance is infeasible.

Other members of the project with assigned tasks become **Contributors**. These members must:

**1. Provide weekly written updates on progress.** Post updates on work in the “progress” channel under Contribute. **If a Contributor doesn’t provide a weekly update to the DAO, then 5% of the Project Lead's rewards will be deducted per missed update.**  

## Completion

The Project Lead must make sure the following are complete:  

**1. Complete a Final Report.** Use the [Final Report Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aa6rMBh1YwYT0IwhlcM8PStAeI0qeO-WN7C6UrLhq2c/edit) to collaborate on your final report with your team. Each project member must include their own contributions. Reports must be submitted to the DAO through the [report editor](https://moondao.com/submit) on Discord before the end of the quarter to be included in that quarter’s reward cycle. These reports will be voted on by the DAO.  

**2. Return excess funds to the DAO treasury.** Please attach a link to the DAO’s multisig in the final report.

**3. Final allocations for project rewards distribution.** Leads are required to include a reward distribution in the final report, allocating a percentage to each contributor, totaling 100%. They may recognize anyone they believe contributed to the project by noting their contributions in the report, regardless of formal team status. For small teams of four or more, we recommend using [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) to determine these distributions. 

**4. Create Documentation.** If someone needs to maintain the work after it’s completed, or users need to know where things are, please include documentation for the people who come after you.  

**5. Present Final Report.** At the end of the quarter, the team must present the final report to the community.

## Retroactive Rewards
  
The DAO incentivizes people to start new projects with its quarterly rewards system.  

Each quarter, the projects that were completed will be eligible for Project Rewards if and only if they have submitted their Final Report to the DAO and it has been approved by the Astronauts. Final reports must be submitted by the end of the quarter.

**Total Quarterly Reward Calculation**

The total amount of rewards each quarter is calculated as follows:

**1. ETH Reward:** 2.5% of the liquid non-MOONEY assets (NMA) (e.g. ETH, DAI, and other stables) paid in the form of ETH. Assets with fluctuating prices will be priced at midnight of the first day of the quarter.

**2. vMOONEY Reward:** A geometric series of MOONEY will be released as follows:
1. Q4 2022: 15,000,000 MOONEY. 
2. Q1 2023: 14,250,000 MOONEY.
3. Q2 2023: 13,537,500 MOONEY.
4. Q3 2023: 12,860,625 MOONEY.
5. And so on, infinitely, decreasing by 0.95 every quarter.

Of that total reward, 10% will automatically go to a Contributor Circle for the community, where anyone in the community can throughout the quarter post contributions that can be accepted by any of the Senators. The rewards to individuals will be decided via a Coordinape at the end of the quarter like all other projects.

**Project Reward Calculation**  

At the end of the quarter, the Citizens and Voting Members are presented with all the projects that were completed along with their Final Reports. Each Citizen and Voting Member allocates their voting power between what they think is a fair proportion of rewards (out of 100%) that should go to each project. Contributors may distribute their proportion of rewards to each project, but not their own.

After all the members have input their distribution, we publish the results and run this [script](https://github.com/Official-MoonDao/MoonDAO/blob/main/ui/lib/utils/rewards.ts) to calculate the distribution for each project and contributor.

The retroactive reward to each project is calculated as follows:

![[https://gray-main-toad-36.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreib4zb6c22nu5q6cvcuze52222dj2lcm6me7ymawbuao2hz7oqgbqa]]

We multiply by 0.9 because 10% of the total rewards always goes to the Contributor Circle.  

**Contributor Reward Calculation**

Each Project will decide the amount of the project rewards that goes to each Contributor to the Project as described in the “Final allocations for project rewards distribution” section under Project Completion.

The reward for each Contributor will be calculated as follows:

![[https://gray-main-toad-36.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreickvn7iw2fog3slk6y6iurycmikl6mriozjvr42ow7xhfl4rktdju]]

Where the UpfrontPayment is the amount of upfront payment that the member received in MOONEY and Non-MOONEY assets for that particular project. The subtraction will be done in-kind, therefore if the member received upfront payment in vMOONEY then that will be subtracted for only vMOONEY. If the member received upfront payment in an asset different than vMOONEY, then that asset’s USD value will be subtracted from the total reward in ETH.  In other words, **if the Contributor Reward is negative for vMOONEY or ETH, the Member will receive no bonus for that token.**  

**Reward Timing and Method**

The ETH will be given as a lump-sum reward within a month of the end of the quarter. 
 
The MOONEY will be locked for four years and given in the form of delegated vMOONEY that they can unlock after it has vested.

## Project Intellectual Property

Unless otherwise noted all projects use a creative commons license and all their work will be open-sourced to the world.

If the project team wants to create Intellectual Property, they will be represented through on-chain IP-NFTs representing the intellectual property, and the details will be attached up-front with the project proposal. 

## Dispute Resolution

Disputes between the project team and the DAO will be handled through arbitration as outlined in the MoonDAO Constitution.  

If Dispute Resolution through MoonDAO’s arbitration procedure is unsuccessful, the dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration, referring to the rules of established arbitration institutions, such as the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or JAMS, which will provide procedural guidelines for the arbitration process.

## Miscellaneous FAQs

**Can a project change Leads?** 

Yes. If a Lead must step down for whatever reason but the project is not yet completed, an Astronaut may appoint a new Lead to the project.

**Can Leads be external to MoonDAO, or must they be members?**

Leads must be MoonDAO members before they start a project. If someone wants to join a project but is not yet a member, they should be on-boarded into the community and get vMOONEY before starting work.

**What happens if the project misses its deadline?**

If you are going over the originally intended timeline please notify the Senate in your monthly update. If the deadline extends into a new quarter the Astronauts will have to approve the project’s continuation.  

**Who can be on the Project’s multisig?**

Multisig signers should include the project Leads and other trusted members of our community.  

**What if a project requires a budget increase?**

If a budget needs to be increased it must go through the full project proposal process with a justification for the budget increase.  

**How do we amend the project system?**

The Astronauts can propose to amend this system by going through our DAO Governance as outlined in the Constitution.

**Can the community change the project team’s decision about a project?**  

Generally no. However, if concern about the direction of a project is raised by a community member they are free to message the Lead and ask them directly. If a major issue that goes against our rules is presented, then the Senate can vote to shut the project down (end payment streaming, receive treasury back, remove member’s roles, and exclude the project from quarterly rewards).
