MoonDAO does not provide legal, financial, or regulatory advice, and participation in this platform does not constitute an endorsement or validation of any particular project.

All funds raised through the Launchpad are wholly and exclusively controlled by the campaign creators via their designated team multisig wallet.

The security and proper management of funds are the full responsibility of the campaign team.

Additionally, any token issuance through the Launchpad is performed solely by the campaign creators, not by MoonDAO.

MoonDAO does not facilitate token sales, guarantee liquidity, or take any responsibility for how a token is marketed or utilized post-launch.

When you launch a mission on the MoonDAO Launchpad and create or distribute tokens, you represent, warrant, and agree as follows:

- You acknowledge that Launchpad tokens are not intended as investments and agree not to market them as such. Any potential value fluctuations or secondary market activity are beyond your control and should not be relied upon as a source of profit.

None of our messages constitute investment advice, please do your own research. Crypto and Web3 involve emergent and rapidly-developing technology and there is always a risk that unforeseen issues could impact us. Although we feel strongly that we have made everything as secure and foolproof as possible, we feel that it's important to inform the community that these are possible risks:

- Despite the many layers of protection we have in place, the Gnosis Multi-Sig wallet could be affected by theft, loss of keys, or fraud.
- While the community has thoroughly vetted all smart contracts and our contribution platform and treasury has been previously battle-tested with millions of dollars secured, there is always the possibility that a smart contract could be hacked due to an unknown vulnerability.

By proceeding with a campaign on the MoonDAO Launchpad, you acknowledge and accept all associated risks, including but not limited to regulatory uncertainty, technological vulnerabilities, market volatility, and potential legal liabilities. MoonDAO, its members, contributors, and affiliates shall not be held liable for any losses, damages, claims, or legal consequences arising from the use of this platform. Teams are strongly advised to consult with legal and financial professionals before proceeding.
