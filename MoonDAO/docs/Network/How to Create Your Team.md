- [Browse Existing Teams](https://moondao.com/network)

## **Sign In**

_\* If you already have an external wallet such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), you should sign in with that to MoonDAO and skip ahead to Step 5._

   1. Visit [MoonDAO.com](http://moondao.com)

   2. Click the “Sign In” button\

   3. Create a wallet with your phone number, email, or social sign in.\

   4. After creation, the “Sign In” button will change to display the first and last characters of your wallet address. Click on that button again to expand your wallet and copy your full address with the copy icon.\

   5. Send that address to <ryan@moondao.com> – your address starts with an 0x and is a long combination of numbers/letters, _for example: 0xD32a3A57390FA698e0802Ebf8BdA2AAbb60C01a8_

## **Fund Your Wallet**

   1. You can fund your wallet directly through the “Fund Wallet” feature using Coinbase onramp or MoonPay (not affiliated with MoonDAO). Debit cards are usually more successful at this step compared to credit cards.\
      ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXch-TUWV-G9V53YPucU-J0fAMaGHuUj4mCPgKF1mfabOkMxZ0vqdB6h5VwOD_z4zvHGUtV0PSxeXFmvXxSi0pC62FBVuWvJbKG9IhBglcfXAKaVcq_q7e4ctJ1ja40mTgwHKU0PXA?key=dNK6lTkf7eD9GOYdS33HGA)

   2. Purchase Ethereum (ETH). You will want at least 0.04 ETH (\~$145 USD) to cover the price of one team and one citizen, plus any transaction fees.


### What if you can’t fund your wallet at this step?

* If MoonPay or Coinbase onramp aren’t working for you, you can create an account at [Coinbase.com](http://coinbase.com) or any other central exchange, and purchase Ethereum directly.

   * It may take up to 3-5 business days for the funds to clear from your payment source and be available to transfer outside of Coinbase.

   * Once you’ve purchased ETH and your payment has cleared, transfer it to your external wallet address from Step 1 on the Arbitrum network. Do not transfer on ETH mainnet or any other network or you will need to [bridge funds to Arbitrum](https://bridge.arbitrum.io).

      * In Coinbase: click on “Transfer” in the top right > Send Crypto. Select “Ethereum” from the send asset selector, then change the network to **“Arbitrum”**. Send MAX to your wallet address from Step 1E above.

        See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdDHgPEfYX0) for help.

* Upon funding your wallet, you can proceed to Step 3 to create a team.

## **Create a Team**

8. At checkout, review the photo, profile info, and review the terms and conditions.
