## Citizen FAQs

**What benefits do Citizens receive?**
Citizens can get [paid for their contributions](https://moondao.com/contribute) towards enabling a long-term human presence on the Moon (or anything else the community feels is valuable), [get hired](https://moondao.com/jobs) directly by teams in the network, [submit proposals](https://moondao.com/submit) to receive funding for their projects, and show up in our [network directory](https://moondao.com/citizens).

**How do I become a Citizen?**
Click [here](https://moondao.com/citizen) and follow the steps. See: [[How to Become a Citizen]]

**Do I need a wallet to join the Network?**
Yes. If you don’t already have one, we will make one for you if you click “Sign In” and create an account.

**How much does it cost to be a Citizen?**
The current price is available [here](https://moondao.com/join). After becoming a Citizen, you can extend your membership for as many years as you’d like for the same price. Prices may change over time, but you’ll be grandfathered in at the current price if you purchase in advance.

**How do I extend my membership?**
On your Citizen profile click “Extend Plan” and enter the number of years you’d like to extend your membership.

**Do I need to be a Citizen to participate in MoonDAO?**
Anyone can participate in our community, even if they are not Citizens. They can [join Discord](https://discord.gg/moondao), acquire our governance token, and vote on proposals without being a Citizen. Although it’s not required, it’s highly encouraged to become a Citizen to access the full opportunities MoonDAO can offer.

**How do I fund my wallet?**
Click on the top left purple button, in the dropdown select “fund” and follow the instructions. If you need support with this step you can create a ticket in our Discord [here](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1212113005836247050) or email info@moondao.com.

**How is data handled on the website?**
We are an open source community, and data is stored onchain. This means it is written to the blockchain, please be aware that all data is public, except for email. You can request for your data to be removed from our front-end website, and then your profile will no longer show up on https://moondao.com. To delete your profile, navigate to your profile page and click the “edit” button and then "delete data."




## Teams FAQs:


**What is a Team?**
Teams are companies, nonprofits, communities, or internal groups that are coordinating together using our tools to accelerate a permanent human presence on the Moon. MoonDAO teams interface directly with the MoonDAO community, allowing them access to fund, hire, and sell directly to the MoonDAO community.

**How do I create a Team?**
Currently you must apply to create a Team. Go to https://moondao.com/join and click “Create a Team” to fill out the application form. You should hear back within a few days. See: [[How to Create Your Team]]

**What is the difference between a Manager and a Member role?**
Managers can edit the team page directly, Members are displayed as part of the team and can access the teams portal but cannot edit the public team page.

**How do I add team members?**
On your team page, Managers can go to the Team section and click “Manage Team," in the modal click "Add member" and select their role from the dropdown menu and add their wallet address.

**Can I configure my organization differently?**
Yes! If you can dream it you can build it with hats protocol. Our frontend only recognizes Manager and Member hats, but beyond that you can structure things however you’d like. If you’d like us to support your particular use case let us know.

**How do I add more signers to the multisignature wallet?**
On your Team page click on “Treasury,” then on the Gnosis interface go to “Settings” and “Manage Safe Account Signers.” Don’t forget to update the number of confirmations needed to sign a transaction.

**How do I extend my subscription?**
At the top of the page click “Extend Plan” and enter the number of years you’d like to extend.

**What happens if my subscription expires?**
You will lose access to your portal and the features of the team. The assets in your wallet are still yours and can always be used regardless of your subscription.

**How do I edit the bio or other page details?**
Click on the pencil icon in the top right.

**How do I add items to the marketplace?**

**How do I get paid from the marketplace?**
People can pay onchain for your item, and the funds will go to your treasury.

**How do I take money out of the Treasury?**
On your profile click on the “Treasury,” button. This will take you to the Gnosis Safe UI where you can send the funds to any other wallet or exchange.

**How do I edit the signers on the Treasury?**
On your team page click “Treasury.” From the Gnosis Safe UI click on “Settings” and then “Add new member,” then sign the transaction in the “Transactions” section to execute the change.

**How will I get notified about purchased items on the marketplace?**
The listed Point of Contact will get an email for every purchased item and then you can handle the fulfillment directly.
