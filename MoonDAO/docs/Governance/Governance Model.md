# Governance Guide
**Step 0: Participate in Governance** 
While not explicitly required, we recommend becoming a member and familiarizing yourself with our processes. You can obtain $MOONEY, our governance token, [here](https://moondao.com/get-mooney). This will allow you to vote on proposals and co-govern MoonDAO. New proposals [go up for a vote once a week](https://moondao.com/vote) on Thursdays for a five-day voting period, at minimum.

**Step 1: Ideation** 
Even if you’re not a member, you can pitch an idea or weigh in on other people's ideas in our [Ideation channel](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1027658256706961509) - there is no formal structure to post, and anyone can share a loose idea for feedback. No pressure. 

**Step 2: Submit a Proposal** 
When you’re ready to submit a more formal proposal, you can do so [here](https://moondao.com/submit). Most successful submissions have already been discussed in ideation to improve them and get feedback, but you may also submit directly ⁠without a thread in ideation. 

**Step 3: Townhall Discussion** 
**Every Thursday at 3PM Eastern** we discuss proposals in Discord in the [Ground-Control](https://moondao.com/meet) voice channel. Everyone is welcome to listen and participate. We record these meetings as well and you can view previous town halls on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@officialmoondao/streams). 

- **Wednesday 3PM Eastern:** Proposal Submission Deadline. 
The proposal may be edited up until the town hall begins, but the submission should be made at least 24 hours before the meeting.
- **Thursday 3PM Eastern:** Townhall Discussion. 
Please be prepared to present your proposal during the next town hall after submission and be prepared to answer questions.
- **Thursday 7PM Eastern:** Snapshot Vote Opens, if the proposal passes Senate temperature check.
- **Tuesday 7PM Eastern:** Snapshot Vote closes.
- If the proposal passes, we proceed to on-chain execution and queue the transaction for review by the treasury multi-sig signers in order to fund the project.

## High-level Governance Overview

MoonDAO is composed of three governing bodies:
1. **The MoonDAO Senate.** This is a group of project leads that review incoming proposals and perform due-diligence before it goes up to vote for the rest of the DAO.
2. **Member House.** The member house is composed of all the $vMOONEY holders which grants the right to vote. We use off-chain voting of onchain $MOONEY tokens that are locked. [Voting Hub](https://moondao.com/vote).
3. **Executive Branch.** If the vote is approved by the DAO, our on-chain smart contract signers execute the proposal from our [Gnosis Treasury](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xce4a1E86a5c47CD677338f53DA22A91d85cab2c9/balances).

Please read [our constitution](Constitution.md) for definitions and in-depth detail. 

**We are in the process of implementing all features of our Constitution onchain.**

For now, the current governance system for MoonDAO works as follows:

## Proposal Flow

1. Anyone can create a proposal. To begin, create a post in [the ideation channel](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1027658256706961509) and get feedback on the idea from the community. Once the idea is fully formed, you may formalize the proposal for [submission](https://moondao.com/submit)
2. The Senate will do due-diligence on the proposal for constitutionality and mission-alignment, if the proposal receives more than 70% approval from the Senate it moves to a vote by all the $vMOONEY holders in the Member House. Seats on the senate can not be bought, the Senate is composed of people that are leading or have lead MoonDAO projects.
3. The $vMOONEY holders vote on the proposal, if a super majority agree it goes to the treasury for signing.
4. The Treasury signers execute the proposal’s onchain components (sending funds, or implementing an onchain update to the DAO’s functions).

## Senate Meetings

The [[Senate]] meets on a weekly basis (at the Town Hall event) to review incoming proposals. Senate meetings are a forum for the Senators to ask deeper questions about a proposal and conduct due-diligence about the submission prior to a member vote.

During and after the Town Hall, the Senate has an anonymous voting window to determine whether the proposal is valid and constitutionally-aligned with MoonDAO's values.

## Proposal Timing

> If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together. 

We are trying to optimize the speed that our DAO moves without sacrificing on quality of decision-making or decentralization. From the time of proposal approval, please expect approximately two weeks until the funds are sent from our treasury.

General timing expectations:

1. Submit a proposal to the Senate before the Town Hall time (preferably 48 hours in advance).
2. vMOONEY Member House has a five day voting period for project proposals and 10 days for governance related changes.
3. On-chain execution of funding within seven days, ideally less, of voter approval.

Therefore, please expect at least 12-15 days for a proposal to go through to the funding stage.
