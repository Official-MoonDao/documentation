# Governance Guide
**Step 0: Participate in Governance** 
While not explicitly required, we recommend becoming a member and familiarizing yourself with our processes. You can obtain $MOONEY, our governance token, [here](https://moondao.com/get-mooney). This will allow you to vote on proposals and co-govern MoonDAO. New proposals [go up for a vote once a week](https://moondao.com/vote) on Thursdays for a five-day voting period, at minimum.

**Step 1: Ideation** 
Even if you’re not a member, you can pitch an idea or weigh in on other people's ideas in our [Ideation channel](⁠https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1027658256706961509) - there is no formal structure to post, and anyone can share a loose idea for feedback. No pressure. 

**Step 2: Submit a Proposal** 
When you’re ready to submit a more formal proposal, you can do so [here](https://moondao.com/propose). A @Delegate will need to sponsor the proposal (a @Delegate is someone with at least 250,000 vMOONEY that can submit on your behalf - or if you have that amount, you may submit directly). Most successful submissions have already been discussed in ideation to improve them and get feedback, but you may also submit directly ⁠without a thread in ideation. 

**Step 3: Townhall Discussion** 
**Every Thursday at 7PM UTC** we discuss proposals in Discord in the [Ground-Control](⁠https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/917498630510878821) voice channel. Everyone is welcome to listen and participate. We record these meetings as well and you can view previous town halls on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@officialmoondao/streams). 

- **Wednesday 7PM UTC:** Proposal Submission Deadline. 
The proposal may be edited up until the town hall begins, but the submission should be made at least 24 hours before the meeting.
- **Thursday 7PM UTC:** Townhall Discussion. 
Please be prepared to present your proposal during the town hall after submission and be prepared to answer questions.
- **Friday 12:00 AM UTC:** Snapshot Vote Opens.
- **Wednesday 12:00 AM UTC:** Snapshot Vote closes.
- If the proposal passes, we proceed to on-chain execution and queue the transaction for review by the treasury multi-sig signers in order to fund the project.

## High-level Governance Overview

MoonDAO is composed of three governing bodies:
1. **The MoonDAO Senate.** This is a group of contributors that review incoming Proposals and perform due-diligence before it goes up for vote for the rest of the DAO.
2. **Member House.** The member house is composed of all the vMOONEY holders which grants the right to vote. We use off-chain voting of on-chain governance tokens that are locked. [Voting Hub](https://moondao.com/vote).
3. **Executive Branch.** If the vote is approved by the DAO, our on-chain smart contract signers execute the proposal from our [Gnosis Treasury](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xce4a1E86a5c47CD677338f53DA22A91d85cab2c9/balances).

Please read [our constitution](Constitution.md) for definitions and in-depth detail. 

**We are in the process of implementing all features of our Constitution on-chain.**

For now, the current governance system for MoonDAO works as follows:

## Proposal Flow

1. Anyone can create a proposal. To begin, create a post in [the ideation channel](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1027658256706961509) and get feedback on the idea from the community. Once the idea is fully formed, you may formalize the proposal for [submission](https://moondao.com/propose)
2. Once a proposal is submitted, a MoonDAO Delegate (anyone with 250,000+ vMOONEY) will need to sponsor the proposal in order move it forward to the MoonDAO Senate. If you have the required amount of vMOONEY, you can serve as the sponsor.
3. The Senate will do due-diligence on the proposal for constitutionality and mission-alignment, if the proposal receives more than 70% approval from the Senate it moves to a vote by all the vMOONEY holders in the Member House. Seats on the senate can not be bought, the Senate is composed of people that are leading or have lead MoonDAO projects.
4. The vMOONEY holders vote on the proposal, if more than 70% agree it goes to the on-chain treasury for signing.
5. The Treasury signers execute the proposal’s on-chain components (sending funds, or implementing an on-chain update to the DAO’s functions).

## Senate Meetings

The [[Senate]] meets on a weekly basis (at the Town Hall event) to review incoming proposal. Senate meetings are a forum for the Senators to ask deeper questions about a proposal and conduct due-diligence about the submission prior to a member vote.

During and after the Town Hall, the Senate has an anonymous voting window to determine whether the proposal is valid and constitutionally-aligned with MoonDAO's values.

## Proposal Timing

> If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together. 

We are trying to optimize the speed that our DAO moves without sacrificing on quality of decision-making or decentralization. From the time of proposal approval, please expect at least one to two weeks until the funds are sent from our treasury.

General timing expectations:

1. Submit a proposal to the Senate before the Town Hall time (preferably 48 hours in advance).
2. vMOONEY Member House has a five day voting period for project proposals and 10 days for governance related changes.
4. On-chain execution of funding within seven days, ideally less.

Therefore, please expect at least 12-15 days for a proposal to go through.
