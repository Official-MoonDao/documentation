## Story
MoonDAO was born out of the idea that Internet strangers could collectively fund a ticket to space utilizing the power of blockchain technologies. In one month, MoonDAO raised more than $8 million USD in ETH from over two thousand people around the world. A portion of those funds were used to purchase two seats to space aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket. In August 2022, we became the first organization to crowdfund a trip to space with the launch of [Coby Cotton aboard NS-22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXXlSG-du7c). MoonDAO has tens of thousands of token holders and [Discord](https://www.moondao.com/discord) community members, and hundreds of stakeholders that vote and shape the organization with the $MOONEY token. The treasury and organization are governed by our stakeholders through transparent online voting in line with our vision as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). 

## Mission
MoonDAO's mission is to accelerate the development of a self-sustaining, self-governing settlement on the Moon.

MoonDAO creates decentralized solutions to democratize access to space exploration. Leveraging the trustless and borderless nature of blockchain technology, our platform creates opportunities for space enthusiasts, crypto aficionados, and those intrigued by the synergies between the two worlds to actively participate in space missions and innovations. By fostering technologies and platforms where companies and countries can collaborate, compete, or cooperate, MoonDAO aims to revolutionize space exploration, making it accessible for all.

## Founder
MoonDAO was co-founded by Pablo Moncada-Larrotiz at the end of 2021. Pablo, MoonDAO's co-founder and first elected astronaut, was formerly employed at BigTech but made the decision to withdraw upon recognizing the potential consequences of centralized control over billions of individuals' lives. He perceives decentralization as a viable solution to address these issues. Since helping to found MoonDAO, Pablo has dedicated his efforts to making space more accessible to all and enabling the collective governance of space. Pablo previously held positions at Waymo (Google's self-driving car division), YouTubeVR, and within the field of biotechnology. Although he spent most of his formative years in Ann Arbor, MI, and pursued his education at the University of Michigan, Pablo's cultural roots lie in Spain, as he resided in Zaragoza during his childhood.
