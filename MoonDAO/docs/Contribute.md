MoonDAO does not work like most traditional corporate organizations, in fact, we never intend to become a "company" in the traditional sense. We are a DAO. We are open for anyone in the world to work with us. All contributors are classified as Independent Contractors and they are responsible for taxes in their respective jurisdiction that result from rewards from their contributions.

There are many levels of involvement with MoonDAO.

## Level 0: Join The MoonDAO Contributor Community
The most successful contributors at MoonDAO are self-starters, and the most direct path to successful contribution is through networking. We encourage members to attend our events and meetings to gain context on the DAO's goals, needs, and key players before taking action to contribute. 

Once equipped and verified, community contributors report on the impact of their efforts in the community contribution channel. If vouched for by 2 of our core contributors, the contributions are considered in our quarterly rewards cycle. [Learn more](Community%20Rewards.md).

This contribution level is not a prerequisite for joining a project, but it can be an excellent first step.

## Level 1: Join a MoonDAO Project

MoonDAO Projects are non-perpetual, goal-based teams that are approved to execute autonomously. MoonDAO teams have no over-head from [MoonDAO governance](Governance%20Model.md). 

You may work with a team or as an individual working on a key objective for the DAO. The DAO will vote to allocate resources and budget for your project and you’d be eligible for Coordinape rewards.

MoonDAO projects are autonomous units and may be incorporated into separate legal entities to complete their mission. As the projects grow they may incubate and eventually become their own subDAOs. When you first join a MoonDAO project, you'll join as a Moonsettler, and we advise reading our [guide for new Moonsettlers](Moonsettler%20Onboarding.md).
## Level 2: Lead a MoonDAO Project

Experienced members of the MoonDAO ecosystem are encouraged to start their own projects. This comes with added responsibility of being a Senate member and having a seat on the governing body that reviews new MoonDAO projects.

Leading a MoonDAO project is a larger commitment, you would steward the project from proposal to completion, and be responsible for putting together a core team and completing the objectives of the project on time.

## Level 3: Become an Astronaut

An Astronaut role is given to members that are trusted with stewarding the DAO and helping guide it as it becomes increasingly decentralized. This is the highest level of contribution to the DAO. The DAO can hold votes to select Astronauts, as detailed in our [Constitution](Constitution.md).
