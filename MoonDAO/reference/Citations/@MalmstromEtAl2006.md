> [!info] Abstract
> Landing sites near the South Pole of the Moon have been proposed for the upcoming
Lunar Precursor and Robotics Program (LPRP) and eventual return to the Moon. Direct
line of sight from the lunar South Pole to Earth either does not exist at all, or exists only
periodically in many of the areas of interest. This paper will investigate several different
communications architecture that enables lunar South Pole communication to Earth,
including surface-to-lunar-relay, direct line of sight, and surface-to-Earth-relay.
