Hey I'm Pablo, I used to work at BigTech but dropped out after seeing where the world could be headed with centralized control over billions of people's lives. I see decentralization as an answer to fixing some of those problems. For the past year and a half I have worked on JuntoDAO to allow people to collectively govern their real life and digital assets with smart contacts. Basically making it easier to share things with your friends. I was also a core contributor at ConstitutionDAO (controversially, I "resigned"). Before that I worked at Waymo (Google's self driving car), YoutubeVR, and in biotech. I mostly grew up in Ann Arbor, MI, and went to Michigan (go blue!), but I'm very culturally Spanish and lived in Zaragoza as a kid.
