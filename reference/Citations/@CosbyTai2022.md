> [!info] Abstract
> The Lunar Communications Architecture Working Group (LCAWG) has been tasked by the IOAG to conduct a study for defining a future Lunar Communications Architecture that will facilitate potential cross support to Lunar missions by communication assets owned and/or operated by the IOAG member agencies and their affiliated companies in the private sectors. Such an architecture is intended to serve as the framework for the IOAG member agencies, individually or collaboratively, to establish their Lunar network(s) so that communication assets in the network(s) will be interoperable with each other at the network, data link, and physical layers.
