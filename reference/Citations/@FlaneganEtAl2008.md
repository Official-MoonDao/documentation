> [!info] Abstract
> America's Vision for Space Exploration envisions the permanent return of humans to the
moon and the expansion of human presence across the solar system. A major NASA effort to
develop architectures for lunar exploration and science, called the Lunar Architecture Team
(LAT), completed a multi-center, year long study in September 2007. The concepts of
operations, analyses, requirements, and conceptual designs developed during the LAT study
form the basis of the current effort to decide on the basic elements of the overall space
transportation and lunar surface systems architecture. The elements of the Lunar
Architecture include descent and ascent transportation, habitation, mobility, power
generation and distribution, resource extraction and storage, Extra-Vehicular Activity
(EVA), and communications and navigation. In this paper, an overview of the LAT
Communication and Navigation (C&N) results will be described. This includes the
architecture of the Lunar Network (LN), concepts of operations, spectrum utilization, traffic
model, element design concepts (including lunar relay satellites, surface communication
terminals, and user radios), and requisite technology improvements.
