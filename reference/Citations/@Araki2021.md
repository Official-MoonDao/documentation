> [!info] Abstract
> A new era of manned lunar exploration is dawning. Optical communication technology is expected to become indispensable for high-speed data transmission from lunar explorers to the Earth. This paper describes the expectations for contents from the Moon and the estimated amount of information. Then, two types of Lunar-Earth optical communication systems are discussed, including a comparison between direct communication with an optical ground station (OGS) and communication through a data relay satellite in geostationary orbit (GEO) around the Earth.
