### How much MOONEY should I buy?

Up to you. You can view statistics for how much MOONEY others have [here](https://dashboard.moondao.com/#/analytics).

### Why do I need to stake to vote?

We don‚Äôt want our community to be controlled by day-traders. We‚Äôd rather be governed by those with a long-term view and commitment to our mission. Staking locks your tokens for some amount of time. Stake [here](https://app.moondao.com/lock).

### How long should I stake?

Up to you. The longer the stake the more voting power you have.

### What do I get in exchange for staking MOONEY?

Staking gives you governance inside of the community. [Our treasury](https://dashboard.moondao.com/#/treasury) is co-governed by all the stakers. All our financial decisions are approved by them. You can vote on proposals [here](http://vote.moondao.com). Those that have 250,000+ voting power can [submit proposals](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1034923662442254356) directly to the community, otherwise you‚Äôll need a co-signer with 250,000+ voting power.


### How is my voting power calculated?

We take the square root of your staked balance. This is known as quadratic voting. To prevent people from making multiple accounts we use sybil resistance with [Gitcoin Passports](https://passport.gitcoin.co/). To vote, make sure your wallet has a valid Gitcoin passport (note: Passports resets every 3 months so make sure you re-do your stamps each quarter). We ask that you have a Google Account, Twitter account, Discord Account, and an ETH wallet with at least 1 txn that has existed for over 30 days.

### What are the mission and values of the community?

See our [Constitution](http://docs.moondao.com/constitution). It also includes more details about our governance process and important rules and structure in our community.

### How do I submit a proposal?

You start by posting your idea in the [ideation channel](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1027658256706961509) of our Discord. Anyone can post there. Please outline the problem you‚Äôre trying to solve and the proposed solution. Other members can help you come up with ideas for your project. Once the idea has been in ideation for a week, you can create a formal proposal and submit it in ‚Äú[proposal review](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1034923662442254356)‚Äù.

All proposals from the community take the form of projects to implement the proposal. Once a proposal is submitted for review, three Senate members will do an in-depth review, you‚Äôll respond to the comments and close them out and then it will be voted on by the Senate. Once approved by the Senate it will go to a snapshot for the community to vote.

### Where can I find the proposal template?

Find the proposal template at the bottom of the [Projects system](https://docs.moondao.com/project-guidelines/). You can also find important information there about the rules and structure of projects, if you have never worked on a project before you must join a project before leading your own project. This helps you understand our system, and also helps us get an understanding of your work. We don‚Äôt want to get married to someone after one week of knowing each other üôÇ

### How do I join a project?

Join a guild, come to the guild meeting, and guild stewards will help match you to existing or upcoming projects. Project leaders will decide who joins the project team.

### How much do I get paid for my work?

All of our contributors get paid retroactively. At the end of the quarter we look at all the work that was done, and then distribute rewards to projects based on their outcomes. Then the project rewards are distributed to team members by rating each other through a system called [coordinape](https://coordinape.com/). For more details on how this works, read the [projects system](https://docs.moondao.com/project-guidelines/).

### Where are the funds going to be stored?

Our funds are stored in a Gnosis multi-sig with five of seven signers. Signers can be elected and rotated based on the [MoonDAO governance](MoonDAO%20Governance.md).

### What are the risks?

Crypto and web3 involve emergent and rapidly-developing technology and there is always a risk of unforeseen issues could impact us. Although we feel strongly that we have made everything as secure and foolproof as possible given the time constraints, we feel that it‚Äôs important to inform the community that these are possible risks:

1. Despite the many layers of protection we have in place, the Gnosis Multi-Sig wallet could be affected by theft, loss of keys, or fraud.
2. While the community has thoroughly vetted these contracts and our contribution platform has been previously battle-tested with millions of dollars secured, there is always the possibility that a smart contract could be hacked due to an unknown vulnerability.

### Am I receiving ownership in exchange for my contribution?

No. You are receiving a governance token, not fractionalized ownership. Governance includes the ability to advise on the mission, values, and operations of MoonDAO as well as the allocation of resources to projects that the DAO supports. MoonDAO is taking donations and donors are receiving [governance tokens](Governance%20Tokens.md) with no expectation of profit. These donations are not tax deductible at this point in time.

### Will the core team receive any of the raised funds for themselves or get compensated in any way from this?

The team has not pre-minted any tokens. The community determines the appropriate budget for the contributors through the [MoonDAO governance](MoonDAO%20Governance.md).

### Why is there a 50% reserve on the token?

The 50% reserve will be goverened by the $MOONEY holders, and can be used to pay contributors for their work on MoonDAO going forward, or could be even be burned if that is the wish of the community. We're not going to dump that reserve on secondary markets and dilute anyone without the consent of the voting members. We belieive that voters will likely only do things that do not hurt their interests, and that this is offers more protection to $MOONEY holders as potential voters than letting the DAO potentially deflate their holdings by minting more $MOONEY with no supply cap. Rather, we wanted to set a supply limit and leave the DAO with some portion to distribute for work done for the DAO.

### How will governance work?
