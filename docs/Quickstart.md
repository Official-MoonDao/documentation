### Tutorial to get started at MoonDAO:
1. [Join our Discord](http://discord.gg/moondao)
2. Go through the onboarding process
   1. Post in the [introduce yourself](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/917524355242663977)
   2. [Get the governance token](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x20d4DB1946859E2Adb0e5ACC2eac58047aD41395&chain=mainnet). As much or as little as you’d like. This is your stake in the community. [Lock](https://app.moondao.com/lock) it in the MoonDAO app for governance power.
   3. [Verify your holdings on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/945284940721975356). The rest of the community governance and guild channels won’t be opened up until you do this step.
   4. Join an onboarding call to get direct support and introduce yourself (check our [events schedule](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/923068372428660736) for onboarding call times)
3. Work for MoonDAO
   1. Join an existing project (see our [ideation channel](https://discord.com/channels/914720248140279868/1027658256706961509), project channels, or attend open project meetings listed on the event calendar)
   2. Get paid retroactively with Coordinape (in other words your project teammates rate your performance afterwards).
