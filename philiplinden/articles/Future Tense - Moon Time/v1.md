Time is a resource, and the Moon is off-grid

In orbital dynamics, every second counts and a mistake could spell disaster―for everyone. A vibrant cislunar ecosystem depends on operators handing the reins to the spacecraft themselves when it comes to space traffic management. The first building blocks: precision timekeeping and “time zones” for regions between Earth and its Moon.

Sep 30, 2023![https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aa6aa7](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6NfKXW2P4HqKy8uH-7DAHob57y5DKsDZ4jV2idhgGNz8guA-qgamPFMedGmbXmjdQ7TGQqiVACxajW7fQJyrDM-fCvbl0evsBw49RUyL1Mg3ZGKOXVwif4vn68ieBV4XbHVxgzNu4NwfntqD0uj4QJQ)

Every day, automated systems from public and private organizations crunch the numbers to predict when and where collisions between spacecraft might occur. These systems use detailed models to calculate the orbital position of nearby spacecraft, and if there is a chance any of them might collide. The probability of collision is a proxy for “pucker factor” in space mission operations.

But the precision of the models depends on the precision of the inputs, and if you’re like me, you can hear the echo of your 5th grade math teacher saying “garbage in, garbage out” right about now. At orbital speeds, little uncertainties add up quickly. When there’s a high probability of collision, operators scramble to intervene before the time of closest approach (TCA), using propulsion or differential drag to change the spacecraft’s orbit enough to reduce the odds of disaster.

Satellites and debris in Earth orbit can be measured relatively easily compared to objects near the Moon. LeoLabs, a private space object tracking company, uses radar beams to measure the position and velocity of passing spacecraft to keep the models up to date for nearly 25,000 objects in low Earth orbit. These measurements are accurate enough for satellite operators like Starlink to rely on automated systems for planning collision avoidance maneuvers (CAMs).

Smaller objects are harder to track… collisions make big objects into many, uncontrollable small pieces that are flung out in many chaotic paths…

In space mission operations today, most operators follow a few unofficial rules of etiquette for being a “good orbital neighbor:”

Spacecraft in lunar orbit are much farther away (pic)... Farther=harder to see/measure… delay=slower response times… plus no GPS [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0275106209000447](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0275106209000447) 

In a world where many small spacecraft buzzing around in cislunar space, the spacecraft will have to start keeping track of their own trajectories instead.

### Near misses in deep space

In 2022, two satellites, one operated by NASA and the other by a private space company, had a near miss in lunar orbit. The problem? They were both using different time measurements. NASA's satellite was synchronized with Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), while the private company's satellite relied on a different, proprietary lunar time system.

This discrepancy led to a potentially catastrophic situation, where the two satellites were on a collision course due to their conflicting time measurements. Fortunately, ground controllers managed to intervene and adjust the satellite trajectories just in time to avert disaster. This incident served as a wake-up call to the space community, highlighting the critical need for a unified lunar time system.

The common thread:

1. Better predictions = sooner warnings = more time to react
    
2. Cooperation between operators is essential
    
3. Relying on current workflows is not sustainable
    

### The Growing Challenge of Lunar Traffic

As humanity's interest in the Moon continues to surge, lunar traffic is on the rise. The Moon, once a desolate celestial body, is now teeming with spacecraft, rovers, and even lunar habitats. This increasing lunar activity poses a significant challenge: how to manage the growing traffic safely and efficiently.

Without a standardized time system, the risk of collisions will only intensify. Imagine a lunar landscape cluttered with spacecraft from various countries and private enterprises, each operating on its unique time reference. Chaos would be inevitable, making it nearly impossible to coordinate lunar activities effectively.

### The complication: Moon time passes at a different rate than Earth time

No, seriously. Relativity is whack.

### Moon mission today rely on terrestrial signals for time

Nearly all moon missions rely on earth time sources to tell the time to the satellites, and to measure position/velocity from earth to predict orbits.

This is fine now since there are so few missions and very few involve coordinating with other craft. In a future with thousands or tens of thousands of lunar spacecraft clustered in areas like south pole and efficient orbits, this changes the calculus.

### Future missions will likely be making their own decisions

Local measurements with better clocks, autonomous systems like starlink where the robots coordinate when/who should move for CAMs. This depends on precision timing for good OD and a shared time basis between crafts.

### The Solution: Local Lunar Time & Cooperation

Fortunately, we know how to address this problem, as we've done it before on Earth. Earth relies on UTC as the global time standard, which helps synchronize activities worldwide. Similarly, we can adopt a unified lunar time system that serves as a common reference for all lunar operations.

[https://www.icann.org/en/blogs/details/how-time-zones-are-coordinated-13-03-2023-en](https://www.icann.org/en/blogs/details/how-time-zones-are-coordinated-13-03-2023-en) 

### Space Agencies Recognize the Need

Space agencies worldwide are already aware of the urgency. The need for a unified lunar time system is reflected in interoperability agreements among spacefaring nations. These agreements acknowledge the importance of standardizing timekeeping to ensure the safety and efficiency of lunar activities.

This recognition prompted me to dive into research on how we could implement such a system on the Moon.

Implementing a Unified Lunar Time System

To establish a unified lunar time system, several key steps would be necessary:

Definition of Universal Standards: We would need to define universal standards for lunar timekeeping, likely based on UTC or a lunar equivalent.

Infrastructure: Space agencies and lunar stakeholders would need to invest in the necessary infrastructure to ensure that lunar missions and equipment are synchronized with the unified time system.

International Cooperation: Achieving consensus among spacefaring nations is essential. International cooperation is crucial to ensure that all lunar activities adhere to the same time standards.

### Challenges to Address

Implementing a unified lunar time system isn't without its challenges:

Time Zones: Defining lunar time zones is a complex task. Should there be multiple time zones, similar to Earth, or a single lunar time standard based on a specific location? Resolving this question is essential for effective lunar traffic management.

Communication Delays: Lunar distances introduce significant communication delays. How would these delays affect the implementation of a unified time system? What strategies can be employed to mitigate their impact?

Private Space Enterprises: As private space companies play an increasingly significant role in lunar exploration, ensuring their cooperation and compliance with the unified time system is vital.

## Why Act Now

The urgency to implement a unified lunar time system cannot be overstated. We have the technological tools and the growing necessity for such a system. The incident involving the two satellites served as a warning of what could happen if we delay action.

Imagine a future where lunar exploration, communication, and resource utilization are seamless and safe. Achieving this vision requires a standardized lunar time system. As we embark on ambitious lunar missions and plan for a sustained human presence on the Moon, the time to act is now.

In conclusion, the incident of two satellites nearly colliding in lunar orbit is a stark reminder of the challenges posed by the increasing traffic on the Moon. To ensure the safety and efficiency of lunar activities, we must adopt a unified lunar time system. Space agencies and international cooperation are crucial in making this vision a reality. By acting now, we can pave the way for a future where lunar exploration flourishes while minimizing the risks associated with lunar traffic.

# Draft 2
**In 2022, two satellites, one operated by NASA and the other by a private space company, almost collided in lunar orbit. The problem? They were both using different time measurements. NASA’s satellite was synchronized with Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC, while the private company's satellite relied on a different, proprietary lunar time system.

By putting the satellites on a collision course, these conflicting time measurements almost wrought catastrophe. Fortunately, ground controllers managed to intervene and adjust the satellite trajectories just in time to avert disaster. But this incident served as a wake-up call to the space community: We need a unified lunar time system.

<<Here, explain the different ways that different organizations keep time—what standards are they using, and how do they decide?>>

Every day, automated systems from public and private organizations crunch the numbers to predict when and where collisions between spacecraft might occur. These systems use detailed models to calculate the orbital position of nearby spacecraft, and if there is a chance any of them might collide. <<do these models take into account the different time zones and convert them to try to get an equivalency?>>

But the precision of the models depends on the precision of the inputs—and if you’re like me, right about now you can hear the echo of your 5th-grade math teacher saying, “Garbage in, garbage out.” At orbital speeds, little uncertainties add up quickly. When there’s a high probability of collision, operators scramble to intervene, using propulsion or differential drag to change the spacecraft’s orbit enough to reduce the odds of disaster.

This gets harder the farther away you get from Earth and the smaller the size of the objects you’re dealing with. Satellites and debris in Earth orbit can be measured relatively easily compared to objects near the Moon. LeoLabs, for example, a private space object tracking company, uses radar beams to [measure](http://celestrak.org/) the position and velocity of passing spacecraft to keep the models up to date for nearly 25,000 objects in low Earth orbit. These measurements are accurate enough for satellite operators like Starlink to rely on automated systems to avoid collision. 

But the farther an object gets from Earth, the harder it is to see and measure, which translates into delays and slower response times.  When collisions do happen, they can turn big objects into many, uncontrollable small pieces that are flung out in many chaotic paths. <<are there other consequences of collisions? Let’s perhaps outline them here.>>

This is all complicated by the fact that lunar traffic is on the rise. The Moon, once a desolate celestial body, is now teeming with spacecraft, rovers, and even lunar habitats, and safely and efficiently managing that traffic is crucial. 

A standardized time system is a key part of that management. Imagine a lunar landscape cluttered with spacecraft from various countries and private enterprises, each operating on its unique time reference—chaos would be inevitable.

 But creating that system is complicated. To start, moon time passes at a different rate than Earth time <<explain briefly>>

Today, nearly all moon missions rely on earth time sources to tell the time to the satellites, and to measure position and velocity from earth to predict orbits. For now, since there are few missions and even fewer involve coordinating with other craft, this is fine. In a future with thousands or tens of thousands of lunar spacecraft clustered in areas like south pole and efficient orbits? Not so much. 

Fortunately, [we know how to address this problem](https://www.icann.org/en/blogs/details/how-time-zones-are-coordinated-13-03-2023-en), as we've done it before on Earth. Earth relies on UTC as the global time standard, which helps synchronize activities worldwide. Similarly, we can adopt a unified lunar time system that serves as a common reference for all lunar operations.

Space agencies worldwide are already aware of the urgency. The need for a unified lunar time system is reflected in interoperability agreements among spacefaring nations. These agreements acknowledge the importance of standardizing timekeeping to ensure the safety and efficiency of lunar activities. <<These agreements establish the importance, but they don’t actually enforce standardization?>>

To actually do that, there are several key steps. First, we would need to define universal standards for lunar timekeeping, likely based on UTC or a lunar equivalent. This involves sorting through lots of complex questions: Should there be multiple time zones, similar to Earth, or a single lunar time standard based on a specific location? <<Expand on this a bit—how would we actually define what the timezone would be? What are the steps to doing that? >>

Next, space agencies and lunar stakeholders would need to invest in the necessary infrastructure to ensure that lunar missions and equipment are synchronized with the unified time system. <<Can you give a few examples of what that infrastructure actually is? I think we can incorporate the communication challenges into this paragraph, I’m moving up>> Lunar distances introduce significant communication delays. How would these delays affect the implementation of a unified time system? What strategies can be employed to mitigate their impact?

Once we’ve done that, we need to promote international cooperation to ensure that the time standards are actually being followed. And as private space companies play an increasingly significant role in lunar exploration, ensuring their cooperation and compliance with the unified time system is vital.

While standardizing lunar time will no doubt be challenging, it will bring us closer to a future where lunar exploration, communication, and resource utilization are seamless and safe. It’s time to set the Moon’s clocks for success.
