## Problem Statement
[[NASA]] is offering up to $800k to fund industry-led studies of, among a couple of other topics, "Constellation Topology Analysis" to inform future communication and navigation activities. The solicitation asks for a proposed approach to analyze Mesh, Star, and Hybrid network topologies.

See Enclosure A, Study Area 3: [https://sam.gov/opp/afe50c193c8140a7a1a64878b3d69df4/view](https://sam.gov/opp/afe50c193c8140a7a1a64878b3d69df4/view)

[MoonDAO](MoonDAO.md) has an interest in understanding network topologies for lunar operations, with special interest in decentralized paradigms.

## Solution
**Create an outline** of the effort and tools needed to complete an analysis of the impact Mesh, Star, Unstructured, and Hybrid network topologies have on decentralized and open access lunar services.

The outline should include the following:
- A description of the three network topologies (Mesh, Star, Unstructured, Hybrid) and network protocols for each 
- A description of the decentralized and open access lunar services that will be analyzed
- A description of the methods that will be used to analyze the impact of the network topologies on the services
- CONOPS and operational considerations
- Security considerations and encryption methodologies
- Implications for existing network architectures and prime actors (LunaNet, Moonlight, Surrey Pathfinder, Crescent, US, China, …)
- Test plan and methodology 
- Opportunities for future research
- Opportunities for funding (applicable grants, proposals, partnerships, etc)

**Complete an internal study** of the absolute and relative performance of Mesh, Star, Unstructured, and Hybrid network topologies in the context of lunar communications, with a special focus on decentralized infrastructure. The work related to this study may include but is not limited to
- Creating scripts, models, or simulations of communications network topologies
- Creating data-driven metrics to evaluate each topology
- Documenting research and development actions: actions taken, obstacles and their resolutions, missteps and mistakes, successes and surprises, and lessons learned.
- Preparing a document that discusses analysis methods and results.

## Benefits
Understanding the benefits and drawbacks to different arrangements of connections between network nodes (ie, network topologies) is central to the ability to architect a sustainable, usable Lunar communications network.

[MoonDAO](MoonDAO.md) has an interest in stewarding the lunar "commons" in order to achieve a sustainable framework for decentralized governance on the Moon. If [MoonDAO](MoonDAO.md) wishes to contribute to lunar communications architectures, we should understand the interaction between network topology, communication & navigation, and governance.

Performing analysis and research strengthens [MoonDAO](MoonDAO.md)'s capacity to engage with the industry, builds a repository of knowledge, and potentially leads to the creation of engineering tools that could be used for future projects. This is especially true if the conclusions are based on open data and code, and publishing on [DeSci](DeSci%20Labs.md) to demonstrate reproducibility.

The [Open Lunar Foundation](Open%20Lunar%20Foundation.md) has verbally expressed support for this analysis, but has made no commitments as of yet. The [Open Lunar Foundation](Open%20Lunar%20Foundation.md) is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to the development of the Moon. [MoonDAO](MoonDAO.md) is a community-based organization that is also dedicated to the development of the Moon. It will be valuable to establish how the [MoonDAO](MoonDAO.md) community and [Open Lunar](Open%20Lunar%20Foundation.md) could work together to receive [[NASA]] funding. This will be especially important as [MoonDAO](MoonDAO.md) continues into stage 3 of the [roadmap](Roadmap.md).

If [[NASA]] awards our proposal funding, we could potentially receive funding to compensate contributors' efforts rather than spending from the DAO's treasury. Receiving an award from [[NASA]] would strengthen [MoonDAO](MoonDAO.md)'s reputation as a credible member of the space community.

## Risks

1. We don't submit time, or we don't receive an award. The consequence of this is that we miss out on an opportunity to bring funding to the DAO, and would not be able to compensate contributors for their engineering effort. All the materials generated from this proposal could be reused in future work.
   > [!failure] Missed deadline
   > This risk was realized―[MoonDAO](MoonDAO.md) did not submit a proposal.

1. There are insurmountable legal roadblocks that prevent [MoonDAO](MoonDAO.md) from being awarded [[NASA]] funds. It would be helpful to understand what obstacles lie in the way for [MoonDAO](MoonDAO.md) to receive [[NASA]] funding. For example, an acceptable outcome would be to learn for certain whether [MoonDAO](MoonDAO.md) can be awarded funds directly,  and if it is necessary to use another entity (such as [Open Lunar Foundation](Open%20Lunar%20Foundation.md) or another partner) as a legal proxy. The MIDAO status is not complete, so [MoonDAO](MoonDAO.md) doesn't currently have an official entity in real life that can receive funds directly.
## Objectives and Key Results:

You can write as many OKRs as you think are needed. One OKR is fine if that captures the full extent of what you want to achieve. One focused goal is preferred instead of many. Objectives should use SMART principles (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound).

~~**Objective #1:** Complete a proposal for this NextSTEP-2 solicitation (Study Area #3 only).~~ 

> [!failure] Removed
> This objective has been removed since the deadline has passed and we did not submit a proposal to [[NASA]].

Key Results for Objective #1: 
- Create an outline of the effort and tools needed to complete a network topology analysis.
- Determine how much funding to ask from [[NASA]] as part of this project.
- Create a proposal from the outline that meets the NextSTEP-2 submission requirements.
- Submit the proposal before August 7, 2023.

- [[@gregsearch|Greg Search]] (Contributing Author)
- Gonçalo Esteves (Advisor, Editor) 

**Objective #2:** Set up an internal study based on this [[NASA]] NextSTEP-2 solicitation (Study Area #3 only).

Key Results for Objective #2: 
- Create an outline of the effort and tools needed to complete a network topology analysis.
- Identify and define the nature of each topology under analysis.
- Identify data-driven metrics that can be used to evaluate relative performance/utility of each topology based on these metrics.

**Objective #3:** Complete an internal study analyzing relative performance of several network topologies in the context of lunar operations.

Key Results for Objective #3: 
- Create code models or simulations of each network topology.
- Document the results of the models and simulations with data-driven metrics from Objective #1.
- Discuss the results in the context of other lunar communication technologies and missions.
- Identify areas of future research.

## Team Table (Table A)

Project teams may not need an initial team. It can just be an individual submitting a proposal. As a general rule of thumb, try to keep teams small and focused in the beginning, with clear deliverables and OKRs for each member.
