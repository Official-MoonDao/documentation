- I migrated all of the files in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ShhRGmpVNglUcu3RsECko_I97Xcm1yW_?usp=drive_link) to this vault.
	- The [[Network Topology Proposal]] and [[Research Notes]] were easy to import and clean up for Obsidian/markdown.
	- The [[Primer on Lunar Communications]] has been a pain because it has so many citations.
	- This work is tracked in dework by https://app.dework.xyz/moondao/lunar-comms?taskId=e31ba2e0-a411-4af2-98e6-e9df93704ee8
- I experimented with the [Citations](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-citation-plugin) and [Zotero Integration](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-zotero-desktop-connector) plugins to see which would be the most useful.
	- Citations is the easiest to use while writing by far. I mapped a hotkey to insert a citation from [[zotero.json]] and bam, ready to go.
	- Zotero Integration allows more granular control over what is included in the note and how the template is formatted.
	- Neither allow direct embedding of the PDF file though, so I went with Citations.
- I also created [[Home.canvas|Home]] as a homepage for the project. Not sure how to effectively use canvas yet.
- [[@pmoncada]] suggested doing a [[reading list]] before the first meeting. Great idea.
- Finished migrating existing docs to Obsidian and submitted [dework task for review](https://app.dework.xyz/moondao/lunar-comms?taskId=e31ba2e0-a411-4af2-98e6-e9df93704ee8). Created [[Reading List]] and [dework task/subtasks](https://app.dework.xyz/moondao/lunar-comms?taskId=6e646842-811f-490d-93be-2e812974d1f9).

- A note on the [[Cis Lunar Open Clock (CLOC)|time sync project]]: this network topology work came out of my whitepaper on timekeeping (@LindenEtAl2023), specifically when I discussed "how would the time actually be shared among actors"? The CLOC addresses the other part -- a stable time source local to the moon. They are absolutely related, but can be tackled as parallel/independent projects. Think of it like CLOC being the time, and the topology work being how time is propagated among peers.
- Today I made a good connection here, [https://www.a-v-s.es/home](https://www.a-v-s.es/home "https://www.a-v-s.es/home"). They (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramonbm/) were excited by my pitch for decentralized networking/comms/utilities and are feeling out lunar missions. Keep them in back pocket when we're ready to pitch lunar comms or the open clock
- [[@gregsearch|greg]] downloaded the [[Reading List]] papers as pdfs and uploaded them to dework. I added them to Obsidian.
- [[Gonçalo Esteves]] sent us the following tip:
  > [!tip] from Gonçalo
  > Hi, there are a set of resources and potential proposals to look into, me and Daniel Thompkins just won 1st phase of the NASA entrepreneurship challenge and now working for 2nd phase.
  > I believe I can help this group the same way. Let me know about your interest on:
  > - Establish a calendar and proposal schedule 
  > - Creating articles and artifacts that are interchangeable 
  > - Having a recurrent weekly meeting to review, track and discuss progress 
  >
  > Announcement here: https://www.herox.com/NASAEntrepreneurChallenge/update/5852
  > One Giant Leap for Life:Moon Demonstration Garden by "Daniel Tompkins and Gonçalo Esteves

- For the [[Publish a reproducible work on DeSci Labs|DeSci node]]: I'll nominate [[@RazaEtAl2022]] about hybrid RF/optical lunar comms. It gives interpretable adv/disadv to designs so I'd expect it referenced often.

- new lead on something to work on ![[DARPA - A Framework for Optimized, Integrated Lunar Infrastructure]]

[[@philiplinden]] 
- the idea of submitting something to [[DARPA - A Framework for Optimized, Integrated Lunar Infrastructure]] with AVS is getting some momentum among a few colleagues [https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2023-08-15](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2023-08-15 "https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2023-08-15")
	- Ramon from AVS [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramonbm/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramonbm/ "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramonbm/") (he's the one that found this opportunity)
	- ~~Jessy Kate from Open Lunar~~ interested/excited but on sabbatical
	- Ahmad Byagowi from Meta (creator of Open Time Card) [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-byagowi-b9401631/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-byagowi-b9401631/ "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-byagowi-b9401631/")
	- Ramon found a PhD student from Cornell that wants to contribute

- [Robin Hawk]() reached out over linkedin
	- > Jan Hall won the Nobel Prize in Physics for the Optical Comb. In his early years he measured the Cesium Fountain Optical Clocks that tell time for the World. He and I worked together on end to end optical network systems during the “analog” 80’s, prior to digital. He calls me his “non-linear” student. We are the ones behind the scenes on the forefront of optical clock miniaturization
	- > Digital time is only a display of timestamps, calibrated to the Optical Clocks (along with Satellites) once per day. Without a master reference, there would be a serious drift, incorrect timestamps and everyone would be wide open to hacks, especially CyberPhysical systems. We will be giving presentations on these clocks and the satellite miniaturization at the UN Science Summit in NYC on September 19.
	- > I suggest you start with “Confessions of an Internet Timekeeper”, then watch Dr. Halls Nobel Lecture on the progress of Optical Clocks. We are sending one up and one has already been up and already been tested in Space.
	- Invited me to UN Science Summit in NYC on September 19th
